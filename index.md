I am **Anca Dumitrache**, a PhD student in the [User-Centric Data Science](http://ucds.cs.vu.nl/) group at [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](http://few.vu.nl/).

For the past 4 years I've been involved in the [CrowdTruth](http://crowdtruth.org/) project, where we look into how to capture and interpret inter-annotator disagreement in *crowdsourcing*. I am investigating how to use this disagreement to get better training data for *natural language processing* models. My supervisors are [Lora Aroyo](https://loraaroyo.wordpress.com/) and [Chris Welty](https://research.google.com/pubs/104789.html).

Other interests I have include *machine learning*, *Semantic Web*, *open data* and *data science* in general. My programming languages of choice are *R* and *Python* (particularly the scientific Python stack). 

In the past, I've done internships in the Watson group at [IBM Research](http://research.ibm.com/), and in the NLP department at [Google Research](https://research.google.com/), both in New York. I've also been a recipient of the [IBM PhD Fellowship](http://www.research.ibm.com/university/awards/phdfellowship.shtml) from 2014 to 2016.
